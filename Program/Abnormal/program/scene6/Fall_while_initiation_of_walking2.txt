Fall while initiation of walking2
A person walks to the sofa in the living room and sits on the sofa. After taking rest, person gets out of sofa and walks to enter the kitchen by passing bedroom. Then, a fall occurs at the initiation of walking. It can be concerning and may indicate a balance or stability issue such as foot or leg problems (conditions like arthritis, foot deformities, or previous injuries may contribute to difficulties in weight-bearing or propulsion, leading to falls), and medications or side effects (some medications can cause dizziness, light-headedness, or affect balance, making it more likely for a person to fall when starting to walk).
