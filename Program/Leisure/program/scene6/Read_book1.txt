Read book1
A person walks from kitchen to living room to find a book and picks it up. Then, walks to the sofa and sit on it. Read a book to activate the imagination. Because the brain is busy reading, it doesn't latch onto anxious thoughts as readily. As a result, the heart rate goes down, and the muscles relax. The body burns through the remaining stress hormones in the body system.
