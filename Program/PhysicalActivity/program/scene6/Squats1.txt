Squats1
A person walks from bathroom to living room. In that case, a person needs to pass bedroom. Choose a space to try squats. Position the feet shoulder-width apart, and bend at the knees while raising arms. Thighs and arms should be parallel to the floor. Keep the back of the body straight and avoid extending the knees past the toes.
