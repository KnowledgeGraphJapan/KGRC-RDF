Shoulder stretch1
A person walks from bathroom to living room. In that case, a person needs to pass bedroom and kitchen. Then, goes to a place to try stretch. Take the right arm straight across the chest and curl the left hand around your elbow, gently pulling on the right arm to deepen the stretch in the shoulders. Drop the shoulder down if it is not feeling a stretch.
