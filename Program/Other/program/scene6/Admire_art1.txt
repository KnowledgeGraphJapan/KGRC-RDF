Admire art1
A person stops working in the bedroom and walks towards the living room to look at paintings, and art to stop thinking about daily problems and negative thoughts. The person needs to pass through the kitchen on the way from the bedroom to the living room. Admiring art makes us experience tranquillity, leading up to feelings of peace and relaxation.
